# CODEALPHA_Online_Quiz_Task3
This Java application is a quiz game with a graphical user interface (GUI). It comprises several classes: "Login," "Quiz," "Rules," and "Score." The "Login" class establishes the initial interface, prompting users to enter their names and navigate to the rules or start the quiz. The "Quiz" class manages the quiz gameplay, presenting questions, multiple-choice options, and tracking user responses with a countdown timer. Users can use a 50-50 lifeline and submit their answers, receiving a score at the end. The "Rules" class provides guidelines for the quiz, and the "Score" class displays the user's final score with an option to play again. The application utilizes Java Swing for the GUI components and event handling.
